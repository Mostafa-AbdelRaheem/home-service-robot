# üè† Home-service-robot

An end-to-end learning project to design, simulate, and implement a Home Service Robot using ROS2 Humble, Gazebo, and modern robotics software engineering practices.

This repository documents my step-by-step journey ‚Äî from simple ROS nodes to full SLAM, localization, and navigation stack integration ‚Äî with the final goal of building a simulated autonomous cleaning robot.

## üöÄ Goals

Learn robotics software engineering through incremental projects.
Build a portfolio-ready project that showcases real-world robotics skills.
Demonstrate mastery of ROS2 Humble, Gazebo, RViz, SLAM, and Navigation Stack.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack:
- Languages: Python 3 
- Frameworks & Tools:
    - ROS2 Humble
    - Gazebo
    - RViz2
    - Navigation2 (Nav2)
    - SLAM Toolbox
    - rqt, roswtf
- Platform: Ubuntu 22.04 (WSL2 on Windows 11)

<!-- ## üìö Learning Roadmap
This repo grows through iterative commits, each representing a milestone:
‚úÖ Launching a Gazebo environment

‚úÖ Designing worlds in Gazebo

‚úÖ Building Catkin/Colcon Workspaces

‚úÖ ROS2 node creation & communication

‚úÖ Using additional ROS packages

‚úÖ Gazebo world integration

‚úÖ RViz integration

‚úÖ SLAM implementation (with ROS/Gazebo)

‚úÖ Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL)

‚úÖ Debugging tools (rqt, roswtf)

‚úÖ Advanced ROS2 + Gazebo integration

‚úÖ Navigation stack (Nav2) & path planning

üöß Final integration into a Home Service Robot (cleaning) -->
